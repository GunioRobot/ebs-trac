DEPENDENCIES

	The plugin was developed against Trac 0.10.4, which is ancient,
	but hopefully it will work any subsequent version.  It doesn't
	do anything very tricky, just uses the RequestHandler interface
	and custom ticket fields.

	To use the command-line client utilities, you need to have
	curl and python installed.


INSTALLING THE PLUGIN

	$ make
	$ sudo make install

	Edit your trac conf (e.g., /usr/local/trac/conf/trac.ini)
	to enable the ebstrac component.

		...
		[components]
		ebstrac.* = enabled
		...
		[ticket-custom]
		estimatedhours = text
		estimatedhours.label = Estimated Hours
		estimatedhours.order = 1
		estimatedhours.value = 0
		actualhours = text
		actualhours.label = Actual Ticket
		actualhours.order = 2
		actualhours.value = 0
		...

	If you are running trac as a FastCGI daemon, you'll
	have to kill then restart the daemon.	


INSTALLING THE CLIENT

	To install the client utilities and their man pages, type:

		$ sudo make install-client
