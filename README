DEPENDENCIES

	The plugin was developed against Trac 0.10.4, which is ancient,
	but hopefully it will work any subsequent version.  It doesn't
	do anything very tricky, just uses the RequestHandler interface
	and custom ticket fields.

	To use the command-line client utilities, you need to have
	curl and python installed.


INSTALLING THE CLIENT

	Do this to book time and estimates to the Trac server.

	First, look at the Makefile variables:

		MANDIR=/usr/local/share/man
		BINDIR=/usr/local/bin

	and edit if necessary.	MANDIR is where your system reads man
	pages from and BINDIR is where your system stores executables.

	Once you have verified those variables, install the client
	utilities and their man pages by typing:

		$ sudo make install-client

	To test the man pages were installed correctly, type:

		$ man ebsconf


INSTALLING THE PLUGIN

	Do this on the server that hosts Trac.

		$ make
		$ sudo make install

	Edit your trac conf (e.g., /usr/local/trac/conf/trac.ini)
	to enable the ebstrac component.

		...
		[components]
		ebstrac.* = enabled
		...
		[ticket-custom]
		estimatedhours = text
		estimatedhours.label = Estimated Hours
		estimatedhours.order = 1
		estimatedhours.value = 0
		actualhours = text
		actualhours.label = Actual Hours
		actualhours.order = 2
		actualhours.value = 0
		...

	If you are running trac as a FastCGI daemon, you'll
	have to kill then restart the daemon.
