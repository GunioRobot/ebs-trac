Unit tests for the ebs.py module.

This module primarily computes two graphs:

	1. a probability density function for ship date, and

	2. a box-and-whisker plot for developer ship date.

To compute these graphs, we need three arguments:

	* history 

	  A list of (user, ticket, estimated_hours, actual_hours,
	  velocity) tuples.  Note that velocity is estimate / actual.

		>>> history = (
		... ('mark', 1, 1.0, 2.0, 0.5), 
		... )

	* todo

	  A list of (user, ticket, estimated_hours, actual_hours) tuples.

		>>> todo = (
		... ('mark', 2, 2.0, 1,0),
		... )

	* timecards

	  A list of (user, date, total_hours) tuples, with one entry
	  for each unique user/date combination.

			26 27 28 29 30      

		>>> from datetime import date
		>>> dt1 = date(2010, 9, 1)
		>>> timecards = (
		... ('mark', dt1, 1.0),
		... )

The above three arguments define a very simple example, with 

	* one user,
	* no difference between the historical estimate and the actual,
	* a task with one hour left on it, and
	* a user that works one hour per day (based on timecards)

For this example, the probability density function data should have a
single point---it is 100% likely that this milestone will be done in
a day.

	>>> from ebs import history_to_plotdata
	>>> pdf, devs = history_to_plotdata(history, todo, timecards)
	>>> len(pdf)
	1

The x-coordinate will be the expected ship date, and the y-coordinate
is the probability that the ship date will be on or less than that date.

For this toy, example, the one point has a y-value of 100.

	>>> x, y = pdf[0]
	>>> y
	100

Checking the x-coordinate is a bit trickier, it should be one workday after
today's date.  We'll use one of the utilities in the ebs module to
help us.
	
	>>> import ebs
	>>> shipdate = ebs.advance_n_workdays(date.today(), 1)
	>>> x - shipdate
	datetime.timedelta(0)

The data for the developer box-and-whisker plot should have the following
fields for each developer: min, 1st quartile, median, 3rd quartile,
and maximum.

	>>> len(devs)
	1
	>>> len(devs[0])
	6
	>>> dev, min, q1, q2, q3, max = devs[0]
	>>> dev
	'mark'

In this contrived example, since there is no variation all the statistics
are the same.

	>>> min - shipdate
	datetime.timedelta(0)
	>>> q1 - shipdate
	datetime.timedelta(0)
	>>> q2 - shipdate
	datetime.timedelta(0)
	>>> q3 - shipdate
	datetime.timedelta(0)
	>>> max - shipdate
	datetime.timedelta(0)
